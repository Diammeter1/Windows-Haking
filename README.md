# WARNING⚠️⚠️⚠️
we are not responsible for the damage caused by you to other people, if you have caused damage yourself, this means that you have modified our files or used our applications without knowing how they work. OUR TOLLS ARE DESIGNED FOR CYBERSECURITY,
# Anti Virus/Windows Defender
If you noticed that Windows defender or any other antivirus detected that our files are malicious, this is normal, our files do not hide viruses, malware or any other kind of virus, the Antivirus can detect the Loic.exe file
LOIC is actually a security testing and infrastructure resilience assessment tool. It is used by security professionals and developers to test their own systems and identify potential vulnerabilities.

The problem is that this tool can unfortunately also be used for unethical or malicious purposes, which is why it is detected as potentially malicious. Its detection is mainly based on specific signatures and behaviors that may appear suspicious.

In conclusion, LOIC itself is not bad, but used improperly, it can cause damage.
